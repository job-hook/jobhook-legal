<p>All job listings must represent real and legitimate employment opportunities. Fake jobs, misleading offers, or scam-related postings are strictly prohibited.</p>

<h2>2. No Upfront Payments</h2>
<p>Employers must not request application fees, registration fees, training fees, or any form of payment from job seekers before employment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Job title</li>
<li>Responsibilities</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Salary information (if provided)</li>
<li>Required experience or qualifications</li>
</ul>

<p>Misleading or false information may result in removal of the job listing.</p>
